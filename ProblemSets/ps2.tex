\begin{question}{10}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Disprove: Every triangle has at least one obtuse angle.
        \item Disprove: For all integers $x, y$, if $x$ divides $y^2$, then $x$ divides $y$.
        \item Disprove: For every positive non-prime integer $n$, if some prime $p$ divides $n$, 
            then some other prime $q$ ($q\neq p$) also divides $n$.
        \item Disprove: For all integers $n$, if $n^5-n$ is even, then $n$ is even.
        \item Disprove: For all natural numbers $n$, the integer $n^2+17n+17$ is prime.

\begin{question}{10}
    Another method to prove that certain Boolean formulas
    are tautologies is to use the properties in Theorem~7.2
    together with the fact that $x \rightarrow y$ is equivalent
    to $(\neg x) \vee y$ (Proposition~7.3)
    For example, Exercise 7.11, part (b) asks you to establish that the formula $(x \wedge (x \rightarrow y)) \rightarrow y$ is 
    a tautology.  Here is a derivation of that fact:
    % This is an "align" environment for aligning
    % mathematical equations.  Ampersands (&) denote 
    % separation between columns.  The first one means
    % there will be alignment around the equal sign.
    % The double-ampersands put a second column, left-
    % justified.  Double-backslashes (\\) separate lines.
    \begin{align*}
        (x \wedge (x \rightarrow y)) \rightarrow y
        &= [x \wedge (\neg x \vee y)] \rightarrow y
        && \text{translate $\rightarrow$} 
        \\
        &= [(x \wedge \neg x) \vee (x \wedge y)] \rightarrow y
        && \text{distributive}
        \\
        &= [\mathrm{FALSE} \vee (x\wedge y)] \rightarrow y
        && \text{inverse elements}
        \\
        &= (x\wedge y) \rightarrow y
        && \text{identity element}
        \\
        &= \neg(x\wedge y) \vee y
        && \text{translate $\rightarrow$}
        \\
        &= (\neg x \vee \neg y) \vee y
        && \text{De~Morgan's laws}
        \\
        &= \neg x \vee (\neg y \vee y)
        && \text{associativity}
        \\
        &= \neg x \vee \mathrm{TRUE}
        && \text{inverse elements}
        \\
        &= \mathrm{TRUE}
        && \text{identity element}
        \\
    \end{align*}
    Use this technique [not truth tables] to prove that these formulas
    are tautologies:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $(\neg x \wedge (x \vee y)) \rightarrow y$
        \item $\neg ( (x \rightarrow y) \rightarrow  y) \rightarrow \neg x$
    \end{enumerate}

\begin{question}{10}
	Let the following statements be given.
		\begin{align*}
		x &= \text{``There is rain.''}\\
		y &= \text{``There is traffic.''}\\
		z &= \text{``The football game is happening.''}\\
		w &= \text{``The trophy was awarded.''}
		\end{align*}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Rewrite the following statements as Boolean expressions.
			\begin{enumerate}
			\item If there is no rain or no traffic, then the football game is happening.
			\item If the football game is happening, then a trophy will be awarded.
			\end{enumerate}
		\item Construct a truth table for the statements in part (a).
		\item Suppose that the statements given in part (a) are true, and suppose also that the trophy was not awarded. Did it rain? Justify your answer using the truth table.

\begin{solution}
\end{solution}
% Student: The following is an example of how to typeset a table
	% This is an "array" environment for aligning
	% individual objects. It is similar to "align"
	% Right after we \begin{array}, we indicate
	% how we want to align each individual column:
	% "c" for centered, "r" for right-justified,
	% "l" ("ell") for left-justified.
	% The total number of c's, r's, and l's should match
	% the number of columns.
	% We can use this to form a table. To create the borders,
	% we use "|" (the notation for "divides") to create a
	% vertical line between each column.
	% After each line, double-backslashes (\\) separate lines.
	% If we want a horizontal line after each line, 
	% we use "\hline".
	%For math environment, we can use "$$" or "\[ \]".
	%\[\begin{array}{| c | c || c |}
	%\hline
	%x & y & x \vee y \\
	%\hline
	%T & T & T \\ 
	%T & F & T \\
	%F & T & T \\
	%F & F & F \\
	%\hline
	%\end{array}\]

\begin{question}{10}
    Suppose each single character stored in a computer uses eight bits. 
    Then each character is represented by a different sequence of eight 0's and 1's called a bit pattern, 
    such as 10011101 or 00100010. Provide a brief reasoning for the following questions.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item How many different bit patterns are there?
            \item How many different bit patterns are palindromes (the same backwards as forwards)?
            \item How many different bit patterns have an even number of 1's?
            \item How many different bit patterns have the property that their second and fourth digits are 1's?
            \item How many different bit patterns have the property that their second or fourth digits are 1's?

        \begin{enumerate}
            \item How many such lists can be made if repetition is not allowed and the list must begin with a vowel?

            \item How many such lists can be made if repetition is not allowed, and the list must begin with a vowel or end with a vowel?
